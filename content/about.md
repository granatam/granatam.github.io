Hi!

I'm Artemiy and this is my blog, portfolio and collection of (hopefully)
interesting or helpful posts about various Computer Science topics.

I work in the Compiler Technology Department at the Ivannikov Institute for
System Programming of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Alongside my work, I am studying for a Masterâ€™s degree in System Programming
at the Higher School of Economics.

Previously, from 2020 to 2024, I studied at Saratov State University, where I
received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.

Here, I share my thoughts and experiences on topics that interest me, such as:
* Compiler technologies.
* Operating systems.
* Computer networks.
* C, C++ and Rust languages.
